# EECS 498.008 / 598.008 Assignments1-6

This repository contains my solution (with comments in **Chinese**) for the assignments of EECS 498-007 / 598-005 in Winter 2022.

> progress: 2/6

One can find course resources from [course website](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/WI2022/).

One can find a walk-through note (in **Chinese**) from [my blog](https://zayn.cc), which is organized from:

- CS231n Stanford 2017Spring (video)
- CS231n Stanford 2023Spring (course note)
- EECS 498-007/598-005 Michigan 2019Spring (video)

> I'm planning to upgrade the blog system, so it **will be published later**.

## Other Features
- There is a additional `challenge_problem.py` for `challenge_problem.ipynb`, which visualizes weights for the required 2-layer MLP with approximately 90% accuracy, making manually weights drawing more convenient.
